> Scouting has given me a fantastic opportunity to do lots of activities and things that people who are not in Scouts don’t get to do. It’s about having fun with good friends.

Scouts aims to build and develop young people’s confidence, sense of adventure and outdoor skills, as well as encouraging them to explore their beliefs and attitudes and be creative.  It offers them the independence to put these skills into practice at camps and even on international trips.

Scouts are encouraged to work together and take the lead on all sorts of projects, from community based work to planning games and activities for their meetings.

The Scout Troup is the third section in the Scout Group, above Beavers and Cubs.  The Scout Section is for young people aged between 10 1/2 and 14 years.  There is core flexibility in the age range: young people can join from aged 10, and can move to Explorers between age 13 1/2 and 14 1/2.  It may sometimes be appropriate to extend this flexibility for young people with additional leads.  Please speak to a leader if you feel this is necessary - we will always try to accommodate where we can.

# Structure
A Scout Troop is divided into small groups call Patrols, each headed up by an older Scout called a Patrol Leader, and often with an Assistant Patrol Leader.


# Activities
Scouts are encouraged to take part in a wide range of activities as part of their programme including traditional Scouting skills, such as camping, survival and cooking, as well as wider spectrum of adventurous activites, from abeiling to zorbing.  Participation rather than meeting set standards is the key approach, and there are a number of badges and awards that Scouts can gain to recognise their achievements.

Our Scout Leaders:

Scott Guymer      Scout Section Leader  
Marie Heap        Assistant Section Leader  
Amanda Marcroft   Assistant Section Leader
