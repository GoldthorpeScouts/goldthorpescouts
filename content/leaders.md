All the Groups leaders are volunteers. They give their time for free. But they are trained volunteers - the Scout Association has a thorough training programme that all Leaders have to undertake.  

All leaders have to undergo a full Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check, supply personal references and be approved by an Adult Appointments Committee before their first appointment.  Appointments are also subject to regular review and renewal. 

 We aim to have a minimum of three adults at every meeting, and require parents / carers to join our parent rota, so that they are helping with 1 session in every 6 weeks as a minimum.

All parents on the parent rota will be signed up as occasional helpers and get involved, (subject to DBS / CRB check). If you have a particular skill or hobby that you would be prepared to share with the Group then please do let us know and we'll consider how you could help as an activity instructor.  Of course, if there are parents who would like to get involved on a more regular basis, then we'd love to have that help and support. Itâ€™s not all working directly with the scouts, there are plenty of back room type jobs that always need doing like gardening, keeping the accounts, fundraising and managing our communications.
