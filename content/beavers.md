# Activities

Beavers are our youngest members, and generally meet for an hour per week.   They enjoy all that scouting has to offer;  being introduced to outdoor activities, having the opportunity to be creative, explore their local community and experience the excitment of a Beaver Scout Sleepover with their friends.  The Beaver Colony is the first and youngest section of the Scout Group. Beaver scouts are young pepple aged between 6 and 8 years old.  There is core flexibility in the age range: young people can join from age 5 3/4, and can move to Cubs between age 7 1/2 and 8 1/2.  It may sometimes be appropriate to extend this flexibility for young people with additional needs - please discuss this with a leader if you feel this may be necessary.

# Structure

A Beaver Colony may be organised into smaller groups called Lodges. Lodges can be used in a number of ways to facilitate the organisation of the Beaver Scout Colony. They may provide a ‘home’ area for Beaver Scouts to gather at points at the start, during or at the end of the Colony meeting. During their time in the colony, Beavers Scouts will get a chance to try a wide range of different activities as well as going on trips, days out, and on sleepovers.  Participation, rather than meeting set standards, is the key approach, and there are a range of badges and challenge awards that Beaver Scouts can gain to recognise their achievements.
