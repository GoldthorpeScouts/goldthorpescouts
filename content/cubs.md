> The best part of Scouting is definitely the camps. I love every activity we do apart from swimming. They told us the pool was 24 degrees centigrade. Minus 24 more like!â€™

# Activities

For Cubs, excitement and adventure are key. Their programme offers a huge variety of activities surrounding areas of fitness, global and beliefs; whilst allowing them to be creative and get involved in their local communities.  Cubs are introduced to exciting outdoor skills and take part in adventurous activities, as well as camps and residential experiences.

The Cub Pack is the second section of the Scout Group following on from Beavers.  Cub Scouts are young people aged between 8 and 10 1/2. There is core flexibility in the age range:  young people can join from age 7 1/2 and can move to Scouts between age 10 and 11.  It may sometimes be appropriate to extend this flexibility for young people with additional needs but please speak to a leader if you feel this may be necessary.

# Structure

A Cub  Pack is usually organised into small groups called Sixes, each headed up by an older Cub called a Sixer, and often with a Seconder as well.  Sixes can be used in a number of ways to facilitate the organisation of the Cub Scout Pack.  They may provide a 'home' area for Cub Scouts to gather at points at the start, during or at the end of the Pack meeting

During their time in the Pack, Cub Scouts will get a chance to try a wide range of different activities as well as going on trips, days out, and on camps.  Participaton and personal development, rather than meeting set standards, is the key approach, and there are a range of badges and challenge awards that Cub Scouts can gain to recognise their achievements.

Cubs runs every Thursday during term time only between 6:30pm and 8:00pm
