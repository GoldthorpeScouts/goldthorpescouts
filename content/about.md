Goldthorpe Scout Group was one of the first 100 groups in the world to be established in 1908, originally as the 1st Don & Dearne (Goldthorpe), according to a Scout Association fact sheet, which you can access here: [http://scouts.org.uk/f103775](http://scouts.org.uk/f103775)

In the 1970â€™s the council boundaries changed so that Goldthorpe came under Barnsley rather than Doncaster, and the Scout group became known as the 6th Barnsley (Goldthorpe) Scout Group and ran successfully until around the start of the new millennium.  Due to illness and a bereavement within the adult leaders team around this time, the group  was closed and despite attempts lasting over a decade was not resurrected.

In September 2013,the group reformed and new life was breathed into the thriving 6th Barnsley (Goldthorpe) Scout Group!

We are one of 16 Scout Groups in the Barnsley District area and of course, we think we are are the best!  We have won a number of awards since we opened: 

Proud of Barnsley Children's Champion 2014  
Barnsley Beaver Leader of the Year 2014  
Barnsley Scout Group of the Year 2015  
Cub Scout Leader of the Year 2016   

And we still keep getting nominated!

#### What makes us so good?
