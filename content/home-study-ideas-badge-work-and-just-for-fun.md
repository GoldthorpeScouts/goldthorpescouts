# Virtual Tours

## **Zoos**

### **San Diego Zoo** 

##### (8 hours behind the UK if you want to look at the live cameras) 

The [San Diego Zoo](https://kids.sandiegozoo.org/) has an entire site for kids with live cams, animal facts, activities and games. Check out favorites like the polar bear cam and the baboon cam for an experience that almost feels like being there.  

### **Houston Zoo** 

##### **(6 Hours behind)**

Every weekday at 5pm BST, tune into the [Houston Zoo’s Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/houstonzoo/?mod=article_inline) page for behind-the-scenes livestreams of daily zoo life, including zookeepers bathing elephants, taking a cheetah on a walk or feeding giraffes.

## Museums

### **The Louvre**

You can soak up some culture while wearing your pajamas and take an [online tour of several exhibits](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visites-en-ligne?mod=article_inline) at this iconic Paris museum. The tour even takes you to the Louvre’s basement, where you can explore the ancient remains of the Louvre’s original moat. Be sure to check out the Egyptian Antiquities virtual tour and get up close and personal with the Great Sphinx of Tanis.

### **Boston Children’s Museum**

Powered by Google Maps, this [virtual field trip](https://www.bostonchildrensmuseum.org/museum-virtual-tour?mod=article_inline) is pretty close to the real deal. Virtual visitors can “step” through the museum’s three levels and even walk through the queue, but you won’t find any lines here. They have also provided [resources to play and learn](https://www.bostonchildrensmuseum.org/learning-resources?mod=article_inline) at home while you can’t venture out to the museum.

### **The British Museum**

This engaging and [interactive tour](https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/?mod=article_inline) is super cool. Check out hundreds of artifacts that can be searched by era, category or region of the world. Round clay tablets from schoolchildren in ancient Mesopotamia, a crocodile-skin suit of armor from ancient Egypt or even the Rosetta Stone are just a few of the treasures you can check out from home.

## **Wonders of the World**

### **Great Wall of China**

Trek across 3,000 miles of the [Great Wall of China](https://www.thechinaguide.com/destination/great-wall-of-china?mod=article_inline) without even having to stop to catch your breath with this virtual tour. You can explore some of the more famous sections of the wall, such as Badaling and Jiankou in Beijing, but you don’t have to push past huge tourist groups for the best views!

### **Easter Island**

Virtually venture to [Easter Island](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/4wXhfs-0ooroMQ?hl=en&mod=article_inline), one of the most remote islands in the world and check out the moai — the mysterious giant statues that the island is known for. It’s easy to get lost in researching all about the approximately 900 moai and 300 ahu (or the ceremonial platforms) that can be found along the island’s coast.

## Space

### **Surface of Mars**

Explore the [surface of Mars](https://accessmars.withgoogle.com/?mod=article_inline) in the ultimate form of social distancing. While the team at NASA is currently updating the site, you can still take a peek at 360-mode and get a feel for what the Curiosity rover sees every day.

### **ISS Tour**

  
Expedition 33 Commander Suni Williams floats through the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/suni_iss_tour.html?mod=article_inline) and gives those of us stuck on Earth a tour of the laboratories, observation deck, the crew’s sleep quarters and more. It’s fascinating to see our planet down below from the observation deck and to find out what life is really like on the station.
