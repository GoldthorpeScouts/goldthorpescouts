# Subs
Subs are the lifeblood of our scouting programme and they enable us to deliver a fun and diverse programme. There are a lot of costs involved in running a Scout troop from insurance to our membership of the Scout movement.

Subs is a yearly cost of Â£144 that is split into 12 monthly payments. This means that subs are paid throughout the year and not just at each meeting. After your first few meetings and once you are sure that your Scout wants to continue subs are paid by BT MyDonate system. This system is much easier for yourself and the leaders involved as no cash has to change hands and no banking arrangements need to be made. We even get 25% extra on top as the Bt MyDonate system allows us to claim gift aid if you are a taxpayer. 

## Where does your money go?

### Buildings Payments
This money goes to pay for the Scout hut itself. For the upkeep and other bills such as services, insurance and other costs.
### Section Payment
This money goes to the Scout section and is used to pay for the materials needed to run the programme.
### Capitation
This money goes to pay for each Scout's membership of the scouting movement. And also pays for the insurance we get from UK Scouting.
### Group Funds
This money is put into group funds which is used for a range of reasons such as purchasing shared equipment or funding larger events and activities.
