So first evening has gone very well, lots of wide games, running around, and collecting wood.  We have a lot of wood, think we’ll start the everlasting fire tomorrow morning. 

We have set up 4 scout tents, 3 large cub tents, a mess tent, a games tent and the most important ones the leaders tents.  

The kids have all enjoyed hot choc and muffins, and now after a little settling down gone to bed. 

Many thanks to the parents who have helped drop off their cubs, scouts today, and set up camp. 

Wonder who will be the first ones up, who ever it is please put the hot water on for the coffee... tomorrow is going to be a long day..
