Beavers, Cubs and Scouts is for both boys AND girls!  We incorporate fun and games into every session, promote teamwork and leadership, ensure that the young people are challenged so they can reach the best of their ability and of course provide learning through ADVENTURE!

We run different sections within our group for young people of different ages
